If people depend on your oil, you have a permanent customer. This stands in the way of developing clean energy policy because in a capitalist world, profit will always come first. We could get around this by seizing control of the energy sector and making it a public asset. This would require a global effort as any country who has tried in the past gets crushed by the World Bank and the IMF.</p>','<img src="images/content02-wages.jpg" alt="factory workers in China"><p><strong>Increase wages: </strong>The side of the "make green energy affordable" equation that is always overlooked is the income side. If something is too expensive, it needs to get cheaper or you need more money. Adjusted for inflation, wages for all but the richest have been stagnate or dropping for decades. On top of that, employment stability is not what it used to be. Many people are working casual, part-time or on contract. Stabilizing the workforce and implementing things like a guaranteed basic income would not only make green energy affordable, but housing, food and education as well.</p>','<img src="images/content03-building.jpg" alt="house with slar panels on roof"><p><strong>Improve building codes: </strong>We could legislate that all new buildings be built with carbon neutral materials and are equipped with the latest energy efficient technology. This has been proposed in the past. Industry leaders have said that such regulations would cause the price to rise as the cost was passed on to consumers. Several economists state that this rarely happens. Businesses carefully calculate the optimum price for everything so they can keep prices as high as they can get away with. Implementing such building codes would not increase housing costs, but would likely cut into developers profits.</p>'],contentContainer=document.getElementById("content-container"),contentButtonContainer=document.getElementById("content-buttons");for(var i=0;i<contentButtons.length;i+=1)contentButtonContainer.innerHTML+=contentButtons[i];var targetButtons=document.querySelectorAll("button");for(contentCounter=0;contentCounter<contentButtons.length;contentCounter+=1)targetButtons[contentCounter].addEventListener("click",buttonListener,!1);
